# README pro

# Description:

### This application allows for a user to generate a professional README.md file.<br>The user will activate the generator in the terminal by entering "node index.js". When this is done, the user will be given a set of prompts in the terminal asking for their project information. Once the user has answered all prompts they will save their changes in the terminal with a set of commands.<br>"git add .",<br>"git commit -m "'message'",<br>"git push origin 'branch-name'".<br>Once this is complete, the user will go to the connected GitHub repo where they will find all of their project information set up in a pollished README file.
